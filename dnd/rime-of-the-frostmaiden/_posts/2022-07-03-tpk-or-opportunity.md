So...I did a thing. I had a busy week at work and didn't get to prep for our upcoming session as much as I wanted to. The party was headed to Easthaven, one of the busier towns in the Ten-Towns for DMs to worry about: a public execution, a seance, two potential capers, duergar at the ferry, and a hag killing fishermen. Not to mention the historical flavor of Easthaven, complete with warnings about pickpockets (which is just begging for some random encounters). And so I skimmed. I looked through everything, figured I had at least a basic grasp of what was going on, and sat down for the session a little less prepared than I'd like to be.

The party set out on the Toil and Trouble quest at the top of the session. They handled most of the initial encounters -- the harpies were dispatched with ease, the water weird only slightly fazed them, and off they went to find Maud. The conversation was short-lived: while exchanging pleasantries, our druid, Falere, spotted the remaining fragments of the fishermen they were searching for. And with that the fight was on.

## Just a little unbalanced

According to [Kobold+ Fight Club](https://koboldplus.club/){:target="_blank"}, A party of four level 2 adventurers can have a spirited, medium-difficulty encounter with a single CR 2 monster, like a [Sea Hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17008-sea-hag){:target="_blank"} (450XP). Add in a second CR 2 monster, like a [Will-o'-Wisp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17060-will-o-wisp){:target="_blank"} and, for such a low-level party, you're already in Really Deadly territory (1350XP adjusted XP)! The will-o'-wisp's resistance to nonmagical weapons is particularly deadly for beginning adventurers, effectively doubling its health and (arguably) making it more difficult than the average CR 2 creature.

But the piece de resistance in this encounter is the [Frost Giant Skeleton](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1123084-frost-giant-skeleton){:target="_blank"} that Maud calls for help if attacked. Even if it wasn't fighting alongside a hag and will-o'-wisp, an encounter with the skeleton is completely off the charts and unsurvivable. You can imagine the druid's surprise when the skeleton burst into the chamber, swinging its greataxe down and cleaving her in half with one strike. The paladin was next, and the will-o'-wisp's 50ft of movement ensured the remainder of the party couldn't escape.

I don't pull punches or fudge rolls when I DM. I've tried, and it never works. The players know, I know, and it just doesn't feel right. One of the realities of our table is that there is always a risk that the dice will not be on your side, and that we all have to deal with the consequences. As soon as the first player was insta-killed, panic set in. What was I going to do? Would the table revolt when they all died? Was this a matter of "pulling punches" or was the party doomed from the beginning?

After the session ended, I allowed the group some time to reflect on what had happened and share their thoughts and feedback. I also took to Google, Reddit, and beyond, to learn about others' experiences. While I found a mix of opinions ranging from "a level 2 party can handle it if they know what they're doing" to "this is certain to kill any party that attempts it", I found a very enlightening quote in an issue of Dragon Magazine:

> We were going to include an illustration of a hag in a frozen cave, but as I was writing the description for that encounter, I realized there was no light source and we wouldn’t be able to see anything. I ended up giving the hag a will-o’-wisp companion just so the artist had a light source they could include in the scene.

Now, to be fair, Chris Perkins has more experience than I do with writing D&D adventures and encounters. And a team of editors and playtesters reviewed this book before it was released. So I'm in no place to judge his decisions, but... did he really just turn an encounter with a hag and a skeleton into an even deadlier encounter with a wisp, just so an artist would have something to work with? This could have been one of the starting quests for a level 1-2 party, if they had started in Easthaven!

## Where do we go from here?

The party was dead, and we collectively agreed it wasn't entirely fair how it happened. The players had a few ideas for how to proceed:

* **Just a dream:** Retcon the entire thing, the players wake up, and they're better-prepared for the encounter. Or, at the very least, they'll know to run (or to avoid the encounter entirely). The "Toil and Trouble" quest only requires that they find out what happened to the fishermen, so they can still technically finish the quest.
* **Reuse the party:** A bunch of similarly-named characters arrive in Icewind Dale: Falere the druid is replaced by Valerie. Instead of Kinzoku the paladin, we meet Kenny. Icewind Dale's a dangerous place, and it's not all that surprising that a party sent to investigate the death of four able-bodied fishermen might, themselves, get killed. And why not keep the same character sheets, since they're only level 2 and barely started to explore their classes?
* **He's a gentle giant:** Was the Frost Giant Skeleton really trying to cleave through the adventurer's skulls with his greataxe? Or was he just trying to give them a love tap with the side of the blade? Never mind that we've already seen the hag's modus operandi, chopping her victims into pieces for her stew...maybe she'll wait a little while this time.

None of these ideas felt *convincing* though. They were all cheap tricks, cheap retcons, to undo what happened. And as much as we agreed the encounter was a death trap, it felt too much like cheating. There had to be a better way, and as the DM, I was responsible for finding it.

## A quick history lesson

According to the module, we don't know what Auril's motivations are for living among mortals in Icewind Dale. Let's start with what we do know, and maybe we can piece things together.

Auril was once one of the [Gods of Fury](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gods_of_Fury){:target="_blank"}: a group of four evil deities led by Talos. However, in the late 1400s, Auril took things too far and froze Umberlee's chaotic tides. Angered by this encroachment, Talos, Umberlee, and Malar fought back, leading to Auril's retreat to Icewind Dale. Exiled to this corner of the world, she began the Everlasting Rime in 1487 and plunged the Ten-Towns into eternal winter.

Two other deities play a role in Rime of the Frostmaiden: Levistus and Asmodeus. Their motives are unclear as well, but we do know that the Knights of the Black Sword are sworn to Levistus, and the duergar plot against the Ten-Towns on Asmodeus's behalf.

## Find your "why"

How do we tie this all together? We need to find Auril's "why"!

![Keep calm and roleplay](/assets/images/keep-calm-and-roleplay.jpeg){: .align-left}

Deities can't be killed if they still have believers, but I have to think – taking over the Savage North doesn't really sound like a "punishment" for Auril. Gods known for being evil and destructive don't sound to me like the types to say "yep, that seems like enough revenge for the day." Why would they have stopped here, if they could have banished or trapped Auril somewhere far worse?

Levitus is currently imprisoned in Stygia, a frozen sea in the fifth layer of the Nine Hells. When Asmodeus trapped him there, part of Levistus's punishment was to act as the patron of survival. Levistus preys on unsuspecting victims who find themselves cornered in inescapable situations, offering them a way out, in exchange for their souls or some other nefarious purpose. The River Styx flows through Stygia – but many believe it crosses into other planes of existence.

Wouldn't it be convenient if Levistus had a pawn who could bridge the gap from another plane, who could help extend Levistus's army to another plane of existence? If the Sea of Moving Ice were to plunge further into cold and darkness, it wouldn't look so different from Stygia – in other words, it would be the perfect staging ground for an army of ice devils. When Auril found herself on the run from her former allies, she found herself in dire straits, perhaps desperate enough to accept help from Levistus. With Auril building a hospitable environment, and the Knights of the Black Sword making other preparations, Levistus now has a reason to be in our campaign.

Auril is key to this plan, giving her some much-needed security from being discarded any time soon – or, at the very least, buying her time to think of an escape plan. Without the Everlasting Rime, winter will end in Icewind Dale, and with it, Levistus's opportunity will disappear.

Asmodeus wouldn't be in his position if he was completely blind though – enter Xardorok Sunblight. His eyes and ears extend across the Ten-Towns, keeping Asmodeus apprised of any progress on Levistus's behalf. Xardorok's search for Chardalyn and quest to conquer the region is an added bonus to keep the duergar from realizing they are pawns in a much bigger game.

## Bringing it all together

So far, so good... we now understand *why* all these deities have converged on Icewind Dale. But we still don't have an answer to solve our TPK problem yet!

Hidden away in the Reghed Glacier is the lost city of Ythryn. Ythryn was a floating enclave of the Netherese, a long-lost group of humans that wielded ancient arcane powers. Ythryn was powered by a *mythallar*, a Netherese device used to channel incredible amounts of magic. Ythryn's mythallar, in particular, had the ability to control the weather.

The module tells us that the players can use the mythallar to end Auril's winter, saving the day and bringing warmth and sunlight back to Icewind Dale. If it's powerful enough to end her winter, though, wouldn't it be just as easy to extend it permanently, without having to keep Auril around?

Auril is smart enough to see this too. When she learns of the mythallar's existence, she realizes that her only bargaining chip, the Everlasting Rime, could be gone in an instant. She needs to find a way to destroy the mythallar before Levistus gets his hands on it, or she's in trouble.

Enter our party – four adventurers with lots of potential, who find themselves in the wrong cave at the wrong time. If things had gone just a little different, they might not have been in this situation, but now they find themselves in need of some divine intervention. What convenient timing for the Frostmaiden! Four new champions who just need a little care and feeding could solve Auril's pesky mythallar problem once and for all.

### A note about player agency

It's important to ensure the players don't lose agency here. It will be up to them to decide whether they feel loyal to Auril for bringing them back, or if they want to risk betraying her for the greater good. Their encounter with Auril at Grimskalle will certainly be interesting, as I have no idea what they'll choose to do when they get there.

However...I am definitely trying to tempt them with a modified version of [The Ice Queen](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3zyrxx/warlock_subclass_the_ice_queen/){:target="_blank"} as a patron!
